# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project’s Foundations course!  
It’s a simple website that showcases a collection of recipes using basic HTML.

## What I’ll Learn
- Structuring web pages using HTML  
- Using lists, links, and images  
- Creating multiple pages and linking them together  
- Practicing Git workflow (add, commit, push)  

By completing this project, I’ll demonstrate an understanding of basic HTML and Git version control.
